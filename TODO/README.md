# TODO Folder

This directory breaks the roadmap into per-phase documents for easier tracking.

- [ ] `PHASE_1.md` – Data-Dump Testing
- [ ] `PHASE_2.md` – Data Mapping
- [ ] `PHASE_3.md` – Cross-Platform Submission
- [ ] `PHASE_4.md` – GitHub Sync
- [ ] `PHASE_5.md` – UI & Launch

Each file contains an in-depth checklist. **Work through them sequentially** and tick items off as you complete them.

> Remember: run thorough tests after every phase before progressing to the next.
